**'eid** + sleep...  

*trying to stay on* []

no real to:dos to-day lol<br>
pick up kid @ 1600<br>
get some ish done + gm$t<br>
:o: whatever remains undone from :arrow_down_small:<br><br>
but also:<br>
what ive learned this month of رمضان ::<br>
gm$t is constant; reqs focused consistency;<br>
& proper assessment | planning | forward thinking...<br>
do it asap; in its time; <br>
dont delay:<br>
that leads to more issues like being backed up;<br>
forced to rush thru or eliminate stuff;
anxiety;<br>things remaining undone; or done unfocused;<br>
so . . . d o  b e t t e r ! . . .<br>
do it; esp when its difficult;<br>
early; so it don't run into the next thing...<br>
dont let gains go to waste;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be they nutritious; spiritual; personal; physical; mental/emotional; etc<br>
doing > watching; hearing; listening;<br>
getting shit done is :trophy: & mood-enhancer;<br>
plus prevents from letting the bullshit become us & a gang of shit;<br>
:key: finding a routine + doing the daily mandatory :lotus_position_man: :book: :white_heart: :weight_lifting_man: 
:pray:
+ doing stuff early | 1st thing
+ avoiding bs unproductiveness + distractions<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be they people places or things :flushed:
