                    this is a technical documentation build compiled 
                    to fulfill the final requirement for the

                    |. we are just here for serving instruction or reference for the basics of programming in python, 
                    which is pretty much all we can do right now because thats all we know lol.

                    this is merely an introduction which will hip you to:
                    %ul
                        %li 
                            %a{ href: "#expressions" } expressions, data types, & operators
                        %li 
                            %a{ href: "#variables" } variables & functions
                    | and even run your 
                    %a{ href: "#program" } first program
                    |. 
                 
            %section.main-section#expressions 
                %header expressions, data types, & operators
                %p 
                    %strong expressions are combinations of 
                    %strong values and 
                    %strong operators that evaluate to a single value.
                    | that resulting value can be of various 
                    %strong data types
                    |, with the most common being:
                    %ul
                        %li 
                            %strong strings – e.g., "hello"
                        %li 
                            %strong integers – whole numbers like 5
                        %li 
                            %strong floating-point numbers
                            | – decimal numbers like 3.14
                %br
                %p 
                    %strong operators are symbols (like + or *) that perform operations on values.
                    they follow standard math precedence rules (e.g., multiplication happens before addition, unless grouped with parentheses).
                    in Python, some operators behave differently depending on the data type:
                    %code + 
                    | performs string concatenation when used with strings, ie: 
                    %code "hello" + "world" 
                    →     
                    %code "helloworld" 
                    and
                    %code * performs string replication when used with a string and an integer
                    (e.g., "ha" * 3 → "hahaha")

            %section.main-section#variables 
                %header variables & functions
                %p 
                    %strong variables are created and updated by assigning them 
                    %strong values
                    | using 
                    %strong assignment statements
                    |. in Python, there's no need to declare a variable beforehand — 
                    assigning a value to a name automatically creates it.
                %br
                %p 
                    we use 
                    %strong functions to run code that performs tasks.
                    Functions can work with expressions (combinations of values and operators) or variables (names storing data).
                    some common built-in functions in Python include:
                    %ul
                        %li 
                            %strong print() – displays output
                        %li 
                            %strong input() – collects user input
                        %li 
                            %strong len() – returns the length of a sequence (like a string or list)
                        %li 
                            %strong str() – converts a value to a string
                        %li 
                            %strong int() – converts a value to an integer
                        %li 
                            %strong float() – converts a value to a floating-point number
                %p 
                    next we will show you how to tie these concepts together 
                    | and execute your
                    %strong first program
                    | using the basic information we've learned thus far.

            %section.main-section#program 
                %header first program
                %p 
                    the Python programming language has a wide range of syntactical constructions,
                    standard library functions, and interactive development environment features. 
                    fortunately, you can ignore most of that; you just need to learn enough to write some handy little programs.
                %p 
                    so now we have come to the time to 
                    | run your 
                    %strong first program
                    |. you can view the execution of your program using the 
                    %a{ href: "http://pythontutor.com/", target: "_blank" } Python tutor visualization tool
                    |. 
                    Enter your code into your file editor window. the interactive shell runs commands one at a time, 
                    to write entire Python programs, you’ll type the instructions into the file editor.
                %p 
                    now it’s time to create your first program! when the file editor window opens, enter the following into it:
                    %pre
                        %code / this program says hello and asks for my name.
                        %code print('Hello, world!')
                        %code print('What is your name?')    / ask for their name
                        %code myName = input()
                        %code print('It is good to meet you, ' + myName)
                        %code print('The length of your name is:')
                        %code print(len(myName))
                        %code print('What is your age?')    # ask for their age
                        %code myAge = input()
                        %code print('You will be ' + str(int(myAge) + 1) + ' in a year.')
                %p 
                    | you can see the execution of this particular program at 
                    %a{ href: "https://autbor.com/hellopy/", target: "_blank" }
                    |. 
                    click the forward button to move through each step of the program’s execution. you’ll be able to see how the variables’ values and the output change.
