*pleasee check the file: `forms.html` in the [jason-martin](https://github.com/sir-papi/jason-martin.git) repository to ensure it meets these criteria:  
Create an HTML form that collects the following information:*
*‚Ä¢     Name (Text input)
‚Ä¢	Email (Email input)
‚Ä¢	Favorite programming language (Drop-down list)
‚Ä¢	A checkbox asking if the user agrees to terms and conditions
‚Ä¢	A submit button that says ‚ÄúSubmit‚Äù
‚Ä¢	Use &lt;form&gt;, &lt;input&gt;, &lt;select&gt;, &lt;option&gt;, and &lt;button&gt; tags.*

  *[Conclusion](https://chatgpt.com/share/67d4457c-4390-800c-80d2-0a0cf3175d6c):*
